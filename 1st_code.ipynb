It helps the AI understand your questions and give relevant answers based on what you've *already* discussed.\n",

There are limits to how much information the AI can hold in its 'head' for one conversation at a time. The \"protocol\" is the *system* or *rules* that manage this memory.\n",

      "1.  The AI focuses on and remembers the most **recent** parts of your conversation very well.\n",
      "2.  If the chat gets really, really long, the AI might start to forget things you discussed much earlier in that *same* chat because they've been \"erased\" from its active memory (the whiteboard).\n",

      "**Why do they do this?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because remembering *everything* you've ever said in a chat takes up a huge amount of computer power and memory, and it can get very expensive and slow. The protocol is a way to keep the conversation running smoothly and efficiently by focusing on what's most likely important: the recent stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the **model context protocol** is simply the system that manages the AI's short-term memory (the context) for your current conversation, setting limits on how much it can remember at once to keep things working well. If you have a very long chat and the AI seems to forget something you mentioned early on, it's probably because that older information fell outside its active context window due to the protocol!\n"
